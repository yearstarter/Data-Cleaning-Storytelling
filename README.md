## Project description
### Project context
We are in the summer of 2018. Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded ten years ago in Spain and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.

In addition to offering a wide catalog of products at competitive prices, Eniac provides friendly and professional tech support and consultation to its customers. The warmhearted spirit that thrives with direct contact with the customers is at the core of the company.

Since the company went public, investors have been pushing for Eniac to scale up the business and become a major e-commerce player globally. It goes without saying that it is an arduous challenge to do so while retaining the human side of the business, which is Eniac’s emblem.

Here are some numbers that will help you understand Eniac’s scope (data from April 2017 to March 2018):

- Revenue: 14M EUR

- Avg. monthly revenue: 1,17M EUR

- Avg. order price: 710 EUR

- Avg. item price: 540 EUR

Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Data shows that Brazil has an eCommerce revenue similar to that of Spain and Italy: an already huge market with an even bigger potential for growth. The problem for Eniac is the lack of knowledge of such a market. The company doesn’t have ties with local providers, package delivery services, or customer service agencies. Creating these ties and knowing the market would take a lot of time, while the board of directors has demanded the expansion to happen within the next year.

Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. In addition, Magist provides after-sales services such as stock and warehouse management, product shipment, and customer service related to the shipment.

Magist is already a big player and allows small companies to benefit from its economies of scale: it has signed advantageous contracts with the marketplaces and with the Post Office, thus reducing the cost of fees and, most importantly, the bureaucracy involved in getting things started.

Eniac sells through its own e-commerce store in Europe, with its own site and direct providers for all the steps of the supply chain. In Brazil, however, Eniac is considering signing a 3-year contract with Magist as an intermediate step, while it tests the market, creates brand awareness, and explores the option of setting up its own supply chain management.
Note that Magist differs from e-commerce platforms like Amazon or eBay. Eniac will continue selling its products in Brazil through its own website and brand.

The economic conditions of the deal are already being discussed. But not everyone in the company is happy moving on with this. There are two main concerns:
- Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
- Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?


### Project objective
Analyze, whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.

### Project sub-objectives
    How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
    What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
    How many products are being discounted?
    How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
    How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
    How could data collection be improved?
